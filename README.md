# RLFAP-Solver
Classic CSP Algorithms to solve [RLFAP](https://miat.inrae.fr/schiex/rlfap.shtml). Use python 3.x (I use version 3.8).


## Abstract
This project is part of a semester assignment in [Introduction to AI](http://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~ys02/) class that
I took during my 5th semester of studies in Department of Informatics, UoA.

## Disclaimer 
All code files except solution.py is copied from the [aima-python repo](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python). The heuristic dom/wdeg is implemented based on the 
paper in the project's root dir.

## Testcases
We provide the app with all basic testcases in rlfap directory. Check the main procedure in solution.py for a guideline through the code.
